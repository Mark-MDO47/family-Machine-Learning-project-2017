# family-Machine-Learning-project-2017
We are doing a two-part Machine Learning project this summer

Python is the computer language we will use. Python is a very modern and active language right now.
Note to family: I think Python is installed on all of your computers using a software management tool called Anaconda.

We will also be using the program "git" to do "version control" of our stuff. Git is also a
very modern and active tool that I am sure you will all be using at work. 

We will be using two modern and active Open-Source Machine Learning libraries - SciKit-Learn
and Google TensorFlow. Within the TensorFlow world we will be using Keras and possibly McFly.

Some great resources:

### "Hands-On Machine Learning with SciKit-Learn and TensorFlow" by A. Geron

### "Python Machine Learning" by S. Raschke

### "Deep Learning" by I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio, and A. Courville

### Anaconda - https://www.continuum.io/

### Wikipedia.org

### The inimitable www.google.com

The Jupyter Notebooks as html files:

<B>NOTE: these look MUCH better if you copy them to your disk and display in your web browser, especially the math formatting.
The plots look OK this way.<B>
