# family-Machine-Learning-project-2017
We are doing a two-part Machine Learning project this summer

Python is the computer language we will use. Python is a very modern and active language right now.
Note to family: I think Python is installed on all of your computers using a software management tool called Anaconda.

We will also be using the program "git" to do "version control" of our stuff. Git is also a
very modern and active tool that I am sure you will all be using at work. 

We will be using two modern and active Open-Source Machine Learning libraries - SciKit-Learn
and Google TensorFlow. Within the TensorFlow world we will be using Keras and possibly McFly.

Some great resources:
