# family-Machine-Learning-project-2017
We are doing a two-part Machine Learning project this summer

The first part is Python, which is the computer language we will use. Python is a very modern
and active language right now. I think Python is installed on all of your computers using a
software management tool called Anaconda.

We will also be using the program "git" to do "version control" of our stuff. Git is also a
very modern and active tool that I am sure you will all be using at work. 

We will be using two modern and active Machine Learning libraries - SciKit Learn
and Google TensorFlow. Within the TensorFlow world we will be using Keras and possibly McFly.
