## Computer Tools Used
### Python
Python is the computer language we will use. Python is a very modern and active language right now.
Note to family: I think Python is installed on all of your computers using a software management tool called Anaconda.

### GIT
We will also be using the program "git" to do "version control" of our stuff. Git is also a
very modern and active tool that I am sure you will all be using at work. 

### AI/ML Libraries
We will be using two modern and active Open-Source Machine Learning libraries - SciKit-Learn
and Google TensorFlow. Within the TensorFlow world we will be using Keras and possibly McFly.

## Resources
Some great resources:
- **"Hands-On Machine Learning with SciKit-Learn and TensorFlow"** by A. Geron
- **"Python Machine Learning"** by S. Raschke
- **"Deep Learning"** by I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio, and A. Courville
- **Anaconda** - https://www.continuum.io/
- **Wikipedia.org**
- The inimitable **www.google.com**

Note: this was obviously done prior to the advent of the arrival of many competent LLMs.
